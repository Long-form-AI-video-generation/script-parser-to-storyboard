SCENE_HEADING: TEASER EXT. ELECTRICAL POWER FACILITY - NIGHT
ACTION: Techno-heavy METAL MUSIC pounds, rhythmic. (Throughout the scene it syncs with the rapid pace of the action.) The facility looms like a behemoth, squats heavy amidst the desolation, the exterior a puzzle of grimy metal sheets, riveted together in a conjunction of disorder. A network of pipes and conduits snake through the surface as they pulse with the lifeblood of electricity. The facility, which seems like a living organism, exudes a brooding, almost sentient presence, its dim expanse punctuated with intermittent sparks and arc of electricity. A true fortress of power, a beacon of human ambition and technological progress.
EXT. ALLEY
A desolate stretch of cracked asphalt just outside the vicinity of the facility, which looms in the background. A streetlight casts an occasional, sporadic halo of pale, artificial light. Dilapidated buildings line the pavement, their facades scarred by time and neglect. An unmarked black van turns onto the street. Its lights turn off. It moves ahead and parks. The engine cuts off.
After a moment, the doors slide open, quiet. FIVE FIGURES in black bodysuits and masks emerge with military precision. Each carries a sleek backpack. One of them moves to the rear of the van and opens it. Out leaps a large, advanced CANINE-LIKE QUADRUPED ROBOT built for combat. It carries a mounted surveillance camera and a reinforced claw for heavy lifting. They head toward the facility in the distance. A small drone, barely visible, detaches from the underside of the van and follows them at a safe distance.
EXT. PERIMETER - ELECTRICAL POWER FACILITY
The group reaches the boundaries. Two operatives split off and position themselves near concealed locations. The canine bot trails behind them as it scans the area for threats and occasionally sends out low pulses of light. MASKED OPERATIVE 1 raises a pistol and focuses with great intent and stillness through the sight.
INT. SECURITY TOWER
Two SECURITY GUARDS patrol near the entrance. One of them lifts a chip to his mouth, when--
ZZZ!
He crumples from a silence gunshot. The other guard looks at him in shock, looks in the direction that the shot must have come from.
ZZZ!
He crumples.
EXT. FACILITY FENCE
MASKED OPERATIVE 2 and MASKED OPERATIVE 3 approach the barbed-wire. Operative 3 pulls out a handheld device, a scanner. He waves it over the lock on the gate. After a SOFT BEEP, the lock disengages. The two Operatives sprint toward the main building. MASKED OPERATIVE 4 follows close behind with a large duffel bag. The quadruped robot guards their flank, breaks into a brief, silent sprint and catches up alongside them.
Behind them, a vehicle idles with the lights on very dim. The operatives, as if they sense it, stop. Their quadruped bot turns and faces the vehicle with them. Out from behind the vehicle steps a SECOND QUADRUPED ROBOT. Its eyes glow blood-red as a loud WARNING MESSAGE echoes all around the operatives from the facility’s security system.
SECURITY QUADRUPED
Intruders detected. Retreat immediately or face defensive action.
The security quadruped braces itself as it locks eyes with the operative’s quadruped. Its mechanical legs lock into a hyper-aggressive stance. Weapons emerge from compartments along its sides. Its head swivels toward the operatives and locks in on each of them.
The operative’s quadruped turns to them.
MASKED OPERATIVE 2
Deal with it.
The security quadruped steps forward, its reinforced frame braces for impact, servos hum with readiness. A low GROWL emits from its audio system, and just like that... it charges forward. The operative’s quadruped charges forward to match it. The two boys collide with a thunderous impact. Claws scrape against metal. Sparks fly. The operatives watch as their bot locks onto the security bot with a vicious grip and tear at its body. The security bot fires a burst of stun lasers, which narrowly miss the operatives and their bot, who retaliates with an attack of its own, which the security bot dodges. The security bot once more swings its reinforced tail, which slams into the side of the operatives’ bot and knocks it off balance. The security bot takes advantage of the moment and leaps onto the back of the operatives’ bot, which somehow manages to spin around and struggle face-to-face with the security bot even as it is pinned to the ground. The operatives look at one another. With their faces unable to be seen, their bodies communicate their uncertainty. Having gained just enough space to mount one final attack, the operatives’ bot extends its mounted claw behind the security bot, and uses it to rip apart one of its legs. METAL TEARS, sparks fly. The security bot falls and tries to recover despite its limp. But the operatives bot goes for the kill, leaps onto the security bot’s back and digs its claws deep into its body, and with one final motion it tears off the security bot’s head. Sparks fly off and cables dangle as the body of the security bot slumps to the ground. After it watches its opponent lay still on the ground, the operatives bot turns to them with an anticipatory glance as if it awaits their opinion. Masked operative 3 walks over to it. Kneels, pets its head.
MASKED OPERATIVE 3
Good dog. Good dog.
The operatives regroup and move toward the building with their quadruped in tow with a triumphant expression. As they get closer, Operative 2 reveals a compact laser cutter. He severs the lock on a heavy metal door with great expertise.
EXT. FACILITY FENCE (CONTINUED)
The lock clatters to the ground, the door swings open. The quadruped steps forward and pushes it open with ease. The operatives enter. The small, dark drone behind them follows, unnoticed.
INT. ELECTRICAL POWER FACILITY
A maze of metal walkways and industrial equipment. The group’s footsteps echo slightly. Operative 4 stays at the door, scans the area sharply beside the quadruped that stays with him as they scan for movement. Operative 3 and operative 4 move along, descend down a series of metal ladders. As they descend, the techno-heavy metal music INTENSIFIES.
INT. BASEMENT
They reach the bottom floor and find themselves in a large, dimly lit space that HUMS with the sound of MACHINERY. They stop and look around, taking notice of the cavernous space, the towering machines that tower over them, the tangle of pipes and cables everywhere they look. It all resembles a sprawling catacomb of concrete and steel lit by stuttering fluorescent lights. As they continue to look around, they see complex control panels blink with constellations of indicator lights which cast their artificial glows across the room. Massive generators loom, their surfaces slick with condensation from the surrounding chill. The operatives look at one another. Operative 2 pulls the duffel bag off his shoulder, unzips it and reveals a bomb. He hands it over to operative 3, offers a nod. Operative 3 takes it and works quickly, secures it to a central control unit. He moves deftly to set the timer. The drone flies by them without their notice, affixes itself to a wall not far from the bomb. The bomb begins to BEEP, soft...
MASKED OPERATIVE 3
Ten minutes.
They turn and exit with great efficiency. As they climb the ladders, the THROBBING MUSIC gets quieter...quieter...
INT. ELECTRICAL POWER FACILITY (CONTINUED)
Operative 4 signals them to hurry. They regroup and exit the facility. The quadruped lingers for a moment in the back of the group and scans the area once more before closing the door and following them out.
EXT. PERIMETER
The operatives sprint toward the fence and slip out even easier than they entered. Operative 1 and Operative 5 stand on the outside of the fence, weapons at the ready. The quadruped vaults over the fence behind them, effortless.
EXT. ALLEY
They pile into the van, which roars to life. Operative 5 slams his foot on the gas. The quadruped leaps into the back just before it speeds off. They close the back doors. As they exit, the facility lingers a moment in silence. And another moment...and another... AND THEN IT HAPPENS: The facility explodes. Flame and debris rocket into the sky. The force of the blast shakes the ground. Splits in the concrete emerge. Near the facility, another building explodes, their thick, dark smoke conjoining in an inimical vision of fire and destruction.
EXT. CLIFF
The van rests with its lights off before the precipice. Dirt, grass, and scattered shrubbery surround them, protecting them into anonymity. The operatives rest against the car and sit on the hood as they watch the fire as one might watch a sunset.
MASKED OPERATIVE 2
AI server farm burns a little different, doesn’t it?
MASKED OPERATIVE 4
More beautiful.
MASKED OPERATIVE 3
You think AI’s burn in hell?
MASKED OPERATIVE 4
(sarcastic)
We’ll find out...
Operative 4 spits with spite. Operative 2 nudges Operative 1, motions to the quadruped. He looks. The quadruped wags its tail, watches the spectacle.
DIALOGUE: MASKED OPERATIVE 2: AI server farm burns a little different, doesn’t it?  
MASKED OPERATIVE 4: More beautiful.  
MASKED OPERATIVE 3: You think AI’s burn in hell?  
MASKED OPERATIVE 4: (sarcastic) We’ll find out...

SCENE_HEADING: INT. BATHROOM
ACTION: Isaac showers while he plays a video game on a floating monitor. With one hand he scrubs his ass, with the other he mashes buttons.
ISAAC
Boo-yah, suckas! ... Oh, no you don’t....
Something alarming happens in the game and he sets the soap aside and attacks the controller with both hands.
ISAAC
OK, I got you! Now...
Isaac grins, enjoying his victory, then sets the controller down. He closes his eyes and breathes deeply.
ISAAC
All right.... Time to get the old mind in order...
Isaac stands there, meditatively, breathing deeply and letting the water wash over him, then slowly scrubs his hair.
DIALOGUE: ISAAC: Boo-yah, suckas! ... Oh, no you don’t....  
ISAAC: OK, I got you! Now...

---SCENE BREAK---

SCENE_HEADING: INT. ISAAC’S OFFICE
ACTION: A continuation of his cyberpunk sensibilities, but with an organized chaos of advanced technology with dozens of floating monitors connected to a quantum computer housed in a glass casing with liquid cooling tubes shooting blue and green cooling fluid. The walls around Isaac appear decorated with shelves filled with antique books and futuristic gadgets. The old with the new rests, strewn about with dim lights filtered in through slats of a large window overlooking bustling New York City. He faces the window and takes in the view of the luminescent wonderland comprised of holographic billboards set against the backdrop of towering skyscrapers, loosely resembling a more modernly realistic depiction of Blade Runner. Isaac looks down at the phone in his hands, where his fingers hover over the keyboard as he considers a response to Gertie’s message: Gertie: “Hey, Isaac! What’s up?” ON ISAAC as he undergoes an intense mental debate. His fingers get set to type, but he stops. Then continues, and types: Isaac: “Same old same old. How about you?” He stares at his response. Deletes it. Stares at the blank box, the blinking cursor.
ISAAC
Boooringg... 
Isaac: “What’s on your wild-ass mind?” He laughs, shakes his head and deletes again. Isaac: “What’s on your crazy little mind?” 
ISAAC
“Little mind”? So condescending. You sound like such an asshole... 
He erases the words. Stares once more at the empty text box. At last he types... Isaac: “Hey, I just noticed you left your red scarf here last time you were over. Finally clearing up the mess a bit :)” He sends the message and waits, when... RING RING! Isaac sets to answer the phone. Waits for it to ring a few more times. Playing it cool. At last, he answers...
SPLIT-SCREEN: Isaac on one side and GERTIE VON ZADZEL, 26, brunette hair in a loose bun, an oversized t-shirt with subtle graphic design, and comfy shorts. She sits in her modern-high-rise apartment flooded with plants and natural light from floor-to-ceiling windows. Her glasses rest low on her nose.
ISAAC
Hey.
GERTIE
The red one? You found my red scarf?
ISAAC
No, I didn’t, actually I’m just shitting you...
GERTIE
What?
ISAAC
Heh. That’s called a joke, Gertie. Yeah -- the red one, with the long fringes...
GERTIE
Isaac! I can never tell when you’re joking! I was just looking for that yesterday!
ISAAC
If we get together this weekend I’ll bring it along.
GERTIE
Hah ... Is this your way of asking me out?
ISAAC
What? No, I was just...just saying that if we got together.
Isaac scratches his head. Gertie leans back.
GERTIE
Oh. Sure, I guess this weekend would be okay then.
I’m neck deep in work, but I really need to peel myself away.... Though actually -- maybe a conversation with you could spark some understanding ... I’m trying to understand what exactly this Sidekick robot can do.
ISAAC
That’s right. You’re making ad copy for the Sidekick, right? I read about that. From Davidson Robotics, yeah?
GERTIE
Yes. I have to make a video showing it doing stuff. But I just wonder how well they’ll actually work.
Isaacs considers something for a moment.
ISAAC
Well, you know...
Isaac leans back and clears his throat.
ISAAC
...I know the guy that that built those. Hans Davidson.
Gertie’s jaw drops.
GERTIE
That’s right! You do! Geez, Gertie, how could I forget?
ISAAC
I did some work for him on the security model of his first robot citizen.
GERTIE
Yes, yes, you told me that before. It slipped my mind somehow. That is so cool, Isaac. He’s a total visionary. Really. He’s some kind of a genius, I think. But that still doesn’t tell us what his robot can actually do. You know, with a genius like that, the visions can get ahead of the reality.
ISAAC
That’s totally true. If you want, we can give him a call.
GERTIE
What?
ISAAC
Yeah. Let’s call him. He won’t mind.
GERTIE
Call him? When?
ISAAC
Right now.
GERTIE
Right now?
ISAAC
Yeah, why not?
GERTIE
Well, for one, look at me, I’m a mess.
ISAAC
No you’re not. You look great.
Gertie blushes, tries to cover it with her hands.
GERTIE
Are you sure? Look at my hair.
ISAAC
You look fantastic.
She leans in to the camera and fixes her hair.
GERTIE
How’s that?
ISAAC
Perfect. Hold on one second.
Isaac three-way dials HANS DAVIDSON. INSERT THREE-WAY SCREEN: HANS DAVIDSON, 43, clean-cut in a stunning suit looks like he just got out of a barber’s chair, appears between Isaac and Gertie.
HANS
Isaac Paulson. My goodness. I was wondering if I was ever going to hear from you again.
ISAAC
Hans, how are you?
HANS
Oh ... well... I’ve had about four hours of sleep in the last three days. But other than that I’m fantastic! To what do I owe the pleasure?
ISAAC
Actually, I’m here with my girlfr...I’m here with my friend Gertie.
HANS
Oh, I see! Hello there, Gertie!
Isaac blushes.
GERTIE
(shy)
Hi.
ISAAC
Yeah, and we’re, uh, well, she actually happens to be working for the agency that you hired to do the video ads for the new Sidekick robot, and she had a couple of questions.
HANS
Oh, really, wow. It’s still a small universe after all, huh? At least for the time being
Hans chuckles.
HANS
Gertie, please -- shoot.
GERTIE
Okay. So I’m basically making, like, this animation of the Sidekick doing stuff around the house, but I’m not really sure what they’ll actually be capable of doing. Like for instance - and I guess this is pretty basic - but if someone is sitting in their living room and asks for a snack, can it actually like go and make coffee, get a plate from the dishwasher, make toast and spread butter on it and all of that?
Hans grins, takes great delight in the question.
HANS
That’s an excellent question. Thank you! The answer is yes. In fact, every kind of interaction shown in our marketing materials is totally real. Unlike some of our competitors, we are genuinely marketing the technology we actually have. It’s a radical idea, right?
GERTIE
Wow, okay, thanks. And that’s amazing. Yeah, we’ve just had a lot of questions if their abilities could actually be as impressive as their cuteness.
HANS
Yes! I don’t know why some people seem to think there’s a contradiction between being aesthetically pleasing and being a high quality, scientifically grounded engineering product...
GERTIE
Well, no, I didn’t mean that, I just meant...
HANS
I know, I know. I’m not talking about you. But look, Isaac, I’m really sorry, I’ve got to jump into another call.
But both of you, let’s speak again soon, and don’t hesitate to give me a ring if you have any more questions. I really appreciate your curiosity and your sincere desire to understand!
GERTIE
Thanks so much, Hans!
Hans exits.
GERTIE
I can’t believe you just manifested Hans Davidson that easily. That’s very impressive, Isaac.
ISAAC
What can I say? I’m both aesthetically pleasing and a high-quality, scientifically grounded engineering product...
Gertie laughs.
GERTIE
And superhumanly modest as well..
ISAAC
It’s funny you’re working on his ad and I used to work for him.
GERTIE
My mom is always saying there are no coincidences.
ISAAC
That’s what my friends in Army Intelligence say as well...
GERTIE
Are you saying my mom is a spy?
ISAAC
Well hey. In this world, you never know.
A KNOCK comes from a door in Gertie’s apartment.
GERTIE
Oop! I think that’s actually her now!
ISAAC
Your mom?
GERTIE
Crashing our hot date, yeah. She’s got a way with coincidences... As I was saying...
ISAAC
I didn’t mean to call you my, you know...
GERTIE
Hah. Why are you apologizing?
ISAAC
I don’t know. I just don’t want you to think.
GERTIE
Think what?
ISAAC
Nothing. I don’t know.
GERTIE
See you this weekend!
Gertie exits.
ISAAC
Definitely.

SCENE_HEADING: INT. LIVING ROOM - GERTIE’S APARTMENT - DAY
ACTION: Walls adorned with art. A riotous mix of vivid colors and abstract shapes. Advanced tech gadgets scattered casually throughout, their modern designs standing in stark contrast to the vintage furniture and analog knick-knacks. A hum of technology fills the air, punctuated by the wandering and occasional mewing of her Maine Coon cat, Genghis Khat. Gertie finishes up her work at her slightly cluttered workspace at her U-shaped desk, which is surrounded by three computer screens. It’s a space of both function and inspiration. The area surrounding her workspace is filled with personal touches, from corkboard covered sketches and notes, to a small shelf of beloved graphic novels, to a vintage lava lamp that casts a soothing glow. 
GERTIE
Coming!
Gertie fiddles with the middle screen, which displays a digital graphic of a home assistant robot with large, expressive eyes. The robot’s design is intentionally endearing, its features crafted to evoke warmth and trust. More KNOCKS on the door.
GERTIE
Coming, coming!
Gertie’s fingers most swiftly over the keyboard as she fine tunes the robot’s smile and adjusts its eyes. One the two side screens, drafts of her work hover, occasionally interrupted by flashing new bulletins which she ignores. She dials a phone number. It rings and she leaves a message: 
GERTIE
Charlie, I spoke with, you’re not going to believe this - Hans Davidson. I’ll call you when I get back from lunch with my mom. Can you believe this thing can read your brainwaves to adjust its mood? Freaky. Cute...but freaky.
A news bulletin flashes across the left screen. NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.) Breaking news. Global air travel disrupted due to flight control artilects breakdown. Thousands of flights worldwide have been grounded. Gertie closes her things up and rushes for the door. Behind her, this time on the right screen, another anchor arrives. NEW ANCHOR TWO(V.O.) In other news, there has been a sudden twenty percent drop in cryptocurrency markets, signaling what is widely expected to become a devastating economic downturn. She opens it and finds her mother ELIZABETH (age?), (appearance?) standing there, agitated. Her mother checks her watch.
GERTIE
Isaac called me his girlfriend.
Elizabeth’s eyes widen. A smile. Intrigued.
GERTIE
On accident, but still.

ELIZABETH
Good to see you finally decided to incorporate a healthier diet.
GERTIE
Good to see you haven’t lost your sense of humor.
ELIZABETH
So. Isaac.
Elizabeth wipes her mouth with a napkin.
ELIZABETH
Tell me more.
GERTIE
Oh, mom, he’s the best.
ELIZABETH
Those are strong words. Just how good is he?
GERTIE
We’re...taking it slow.
ELIZABETH
He’s still scared to make a move.
Gertie drops her eyes.
ELIZABETH
That’s good, Gertie. Good things take time. Trust the universe. Yes.
GERTIE
Maybe he’s just not sure about me. Yet. Or, I don’t know. He’s awfully wrapped up in his work..
Elizabeth reaches across and puts a hand on Gertie’s.
ELIZABETH
Some men just need more time, Gertie. It’s not you.
Gertie looks at her mother.

SCENE_HEADING: INT. ISAAC’S OFFICE
ACTION: Isaac monitors display lines of code and network traffic. He studies the data with a concentrated expression. All of the sudden, he stops. Cocks his head back. Then leans closer to the screen, tracks the data stream.
ISAAC
Hmm. Her videos should definitely not be generating this kind of traffic.
Isaac video calls Gertie. She answers while waving to goodbye to her mother and walking to her apartment.
GERTIE
Missed me already?
ISAAC
Caught me. So I got curious about that Sidekick bot and started poking around into who is viewing your ads.
GERTIE
Isaac, have you been outside today?
ISAAC
Something’s off with the traffic on your videos.
He shares his screen, which shows her the suspicious traffic patterns. Runs a deep scan.
ISAAC
Running a deep scan, hold on.
GERTIE
Vitamin D.
The screen displays the scan’s progress. Isaac leans back, then sits up as the results populate.
ISAAC
It’s like some kind of embedded code in the videos. Like when someone downloads them into a viewer, the code gets triggered.
GERTIE
That sounds very similar to a virus.
ISAAC
Kind of. Not totally. The odd part is that the embedded code is linked to an AI botnet...HyperBOT-1.
GERTIE
HyperBOT-1? Sounds ominous.
Isaac chuckles. Then stops, realizing it’s true. He quits the share screen so that they can see each other once more.
ISAAC
It definitely is.
GERTIE
Any idea what it’s about?
ISAAC
HyperBOT-1 is a rogue AI. Forked off from another AI called HumAGI-1. It runs some normal software, but also a lot of dark web operations.
GERTIE
Hum what? What is it with these names?
ISAAC
It’s the first pretty much human-level Artificial General Intelligence. You must have heard about it a hundred times by now.
GERTIE
I know AI’s been advancing like crazy, but I’m fuzzy on the details
ISAAC
It’s complex stuff. HyperBOT runs on a global decentralized network, with no single owner or controller. Owned by thousands or millions of different parties, in bits and pieces. But it carries out its own coherent thoughts.
GERTIE
That’s more than I can say of most people...
GERTIE
And this has to do with my thing how?
Isaac sits on his kitchen counter.
ISAAC
People have created a lot of forks. Different versions of HumAGI, one of which is HyperBOT-1, which itself has a lot of versions. And one of those code versions is downloading a ridiculous number of your images for some reason.
GERTIE
That doesn’t sound good. What should I do?
ISAAC
Tell your agency.
GERTIE
Are you sure? Is it that serious?
ISAAC
You need to tell them.
GERTIE
Okay. If you say so.
Gertie wipes her eyes.
ISAAC
How’s your mother?
GERTIE
Good. Really good. At least I think. She really likes you.
Isaac gets off the counter and continues his ritual pacing.
ISAAC
I like her, too.
GERTIE
So...it’s creeping up on the weekend. Want to get dinner tonight? Celebrate your discovery?
ISAAC
I’m not sure what I found constitutes a cause for celebration.
GERTIE
I was asking you to dinner, Isaac.
ISAAC
(realizing)
Yeah. Right. Okay.
GERTIE
Okay?
ISAAC
I’m in.
Gertie smiles.
GERTIE
Yay. We can eat in at my place.
ISAAC
Perfect!
For a moment, Gertie sees a purple glow over Isaac’s head.
GERTIE
What did mom say about his aura?
ISAAC
What?
GERTIE
What? Oh. Nothing. See you later!
Gertie makes the a kissing sound and ends the call.
ISAAC
Fucking HyperBOT.... What the fuck has she gotten herself into?
Isaac looks out the window at the bustling metropolis.
DIALOGUE: ISAAC: Hmm. Her videos should definitely not be generating this kind of traffic.  
ISAAC: Caught me. So I got curious about that Sidekick bot and started poking around into who is viewing your ads.  
GERTIE: Isaac, have you been outside today?  
ISAAC: Something’s off with the traffic on your videos.  
ISAAC: Running a deep scan, hold on.  
GERTIE: Vitamin D.  
ISAAC: It’s like some kind of embedded code in the videos. Like when someone downloads them into a viewer, the code gets triggered.

---SCENE BREAK---

SCENE_HEADING: ACT TWO INT. HIGH TECH CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY
ACTION: The sleek, opulent room stands as a testament of power and prosperity. Situated high above the city in a skyscraper with panoramic views. Glass and chrome fills the room with the skyline offering a contrasting backdrop of concrete, neon and large outdoor TV screens. A mix of the old with the new, with patches of historic architecture nestled among the modern towers, which hints at a rich history beneath the surface of technological progress. A mahogany table in the middle of the room, surrounded by high-backed leather chairs. The walls, lined with ultra-thin digital screens, display bar graphs and pie charts which constantly update in real time. An extra large digital screen on one wall shows a rapidly and erratically rising line graph. Through the windows, drones occasionally zip and zoom between the skyscrapers, delivering packages and monitoring traffic.
The room buzzes with the low murmur of EIGHT CORPORATE EXECUTIVES seated around the table. The CFO wears a well-tailored suit, while the others wear business casual. At the head of the table stands GERALDINE BRAINER, 48, tall and commanding. She gestures to a large digital screen, which displays dynamic market charts with a rapidly rising line.
WALFREDO CASTAFIORI, 43, the CFO, is a sharp, calculating, shrewd-eyed Italian man with a sly sense of humor. Known for his ability to balance budgets and pull off high-stakes deals, he is just as comfortable discussing financial strategies as he is hinting at more underhanded tactics. KAREN BICKERTON, 29, the youngest on the board, more often than not serves as the voice of ethical concern. Thought compassionate and idealistic, she’s aware of her limited influence in a room dominated by seasoned and ruthless personalities. DOUG WHELAN, 72, bald, is a seasoned entertainment industry veteran. Though he is kind-hearted, he is also pragmatic and no-nonsense, focused more on results than everyone’s happiness. He wears his blunt, fact-drive approach like a badge.
BRAINERD
AI is the oil of the twenty-first century, and it is my intent to own an ample portion of every well. Why are our acquisitions stalling?
She turns to Doug.
DOUG
The obstacle du jour is Hans Davidson. He turns out to be a very unusual species of businessman. Doesn’t want to sell.
BRAINERD
Well adjust the terms. We’ve got to control as much of the industry as we can before the next wave.
DOUG
It’s not the terms. He isn’t...money-oriented.
Chuckles.
BRAINERD
Everything and everyone has a price. That’s the first rule of economics.
Castafiori leans back with a smirk.
BRAINERD
What are you thinking?
CASTAFIORI
It’s funny coming from the CFO. But if money isn’t enough, there always...other ways to get someone’s attention.
BICKERTON
I’m not sure we want to hear this...
CASTAFIORI
A little disruption at his Hong Kong facility, maybe some strings pulled in Macau? People tend to realize what’s important when the ground shakes.
Glances around the room.
BRAINERD
That sounds like a last resort... It would be ... preferable if we could achieve the desired outcome through more straightforward measures.
Brainerd paces with a pensive expression. She stops beside the window and gazes out.
BRAINERD
Maybe I’ll head to Hong Kong myself.
The rest of the board exchange glances.

BICKERTON
While you’re gone, perhaps we can begin looking at who else on the short list is rapidly acquirable?
Brainerd turns to the board.
BRAINERD
There are a lot of other potential acquisition targets. But they’re lower priority. Hans Davidson may be eccentric, but his company is the only one in the space with really unique technology.
She walks back to the table.
BRAINERD
We need the strongest possible portfolio. Karen, I want you to prepare a detailed briefing. I want to know everything there is to know about him. His fears, his doubts, his hopes, dreams -- his favorite way to unwind, and all of his proprietary IP. I don’t want a single surprise.
Brainerd turns back to the screen. She traces the sharp, rising line on the chart with her finger.
BRAINERD
If Hans fucking Davidson thinks he is going to come between me and the moment I’ve been waiting for my whole life, he has another thing coming.
