The rain falls on the neon-lit city skyline. KAITO (19), a young hero with a cybernetic arm, stands opposite GENERAL ZORG (50s), a menacing figure in military gear.

ACTION: Kaito draws his Plasma Katana. The blade hums with energy, casting a blue glow on his determined face.

DIALOGE:
KAITO: It's over, Zorg! Your reign of terror ends tonight.
